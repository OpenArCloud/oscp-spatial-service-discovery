# oscp-spatial-service-discovery
OSCP Spatial Service Discovery


## Purpose

Baseline implementation of the OSCP Spatial Service Discovery APIs. These APIs allow an OSCP client to discover nearby spatial service providers (ex. GeoPose provider, spatial content provider, reality modeling provider). Spatial service records are synchronized in real-time across multiple top-level (ex. country) providers in a peer-to-peer manner through the [kappa-osm](https://github.com/digidem/kappa-osm) database for decentralized OpenStreetMap. Discovery is managed via [hyperswarm](https://github.com/hyperswarm/hyperswarm).

The P2P stack is based on components from the [Hypercore protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org/). [kappa-osm](https://github.com/digidem/kappa-osm) builds on [kappa-core](https://github.com/kappa-db/kappa-core), which combines multiple append-only logs, [hypercores](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore), via [multifeed](https://github.com/kappa-db/multifeed), and adds materialized views. Spatial queries rely on a Bkd tree materialized view, [unordered-materialized-bkd](https://github.com/digidem/unordered-materialized-bkd).

Authentication/authorization is based on JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) via the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) standard. A sample integration with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is provided.


## Usage


Tested on Node 12.18.3

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenArCloud/oscp-spatial-service-discovery
cd oscp-spatial-service-discovery
npm install
```

Create .env file with required params ex.

```
KAPPA_CORE_DIR="data"
SWARM_TOPIC_PREFIX="oscpdev_ssd"
AUTH0_ISSUER=https://ssd-oscp.us.auth0.com/
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://ssd.oscp.clouspose.io
COUNTRIES="IT,FI,US"
PORT=3000
```

Start the Spatial Service Discovery service (development)

```
npm run dev
```

Start the Spatial Service Discovery service (production)

```
npm start
```

## Testing via Swagger

## Search Logic

The query API expects a client to provide a hexagonal coverage area by using an [H3 index](https://eng.uber.com/h3/) ex. precision level 8. This avoids exposing the client's specific location. The service then performs a wider scale query at a configurable radius (default: 5km) to the p2p OpenStreetMap backend and returns any coverage polygons that intersect with the client provided H3 hexagon.

## API Versioning

Current version: 1.0

The API version can be specified by the HTTP Accept header using a vendor-specific media type as per [RFC4288](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4288):

```
application/vnd.oscp+json; version=1.0;
```


## Spatial Service Record (SSR)

Base version of a Spatial Service Record (expected to evolve):

```js
export interface Service {
  id: string; //provider supplied reference ID
  type: string; //type of spatial services provider ex. geopose, spatial-content
  title?: string;
Â  description?: string;
  url: URL;
  capabilities?: string[]; //capabilities, includes supported topics for SCD
}

export interface Ssr {
  id: string; //platform generated SSR ID
  type: string; //record type, SSR is currently the only valid type
  services: Service[];
  geometry: turf.Polygon; //GeoJSON polygon
  altitude?: number;
  provider: string; //spatial services provider, populated by platform based on auth
  timestamp: Date; //platform generated timestamp
}
```


## OSM Document

Documents (OSM elements, observations, etc) have a common format within [kappa-osm](https://github.com/digidem/kappa-osm):

```js
  {
    id: String,
    type: String,
    lat: String,
    lon: String,
    tags: Object,
    changeset: String,
    links: Array<String>,
    version: String,
    deviceId: String
  }
```

## Mapping to OSM Data Model

GeoJSON polygons are mapped to OSM closed *ways* which reference an ordered set of OSM *nodes*. In addition, the GeoJSON polygons are stored as tags within the OSM *ways* to avoid the need to iterate through all nodes on reads. An OSM bounding box query returns a *way* if at least one of the corresponding *nodes* are covered.


## Configuring a Reference Auth Service

To configure Auth0 as a reference auth service please see [Auth0 for SSD](auth0_ssd.md).
